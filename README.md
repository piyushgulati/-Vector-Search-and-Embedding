# -Vector-Search-and-Embedding
 Vector Search and Embedding integrating into GPT-4


This project demonstrates how to combine the power of large language models, like GPT-4, with vector search techniques to create efficient and scalable text search applications. It utilizes Hugging Face's Transformers for generating text embeddings and FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) for efficient similarity searching.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you can run this project, you need to install the required libraries. This project has been tested with Python 3.8+.

```bash
pip install transformers faiss-cpu
Note: For GPU support, replace faiss-cpu with faiss-gpu.

Installation
Clone the repository:
bash

git clone <repository-url>
Navigate to the project directory:
bash

cd vector-search-embedding-project
Install the required packages:
bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
To use the vector search engine, follow these steps:

Initialize the VectorSearchEngine with your desired model. The default is distilbert-base-uncased.

Generate embeddings for your text data using the encode method.

Create a FAISS index for efficient similarity searching with the create_index method.

Use the search method to find similar texts based on a query.

Example:

python

from vector_search_engine import VectorSearchEngine

# Texts to index
texts = ["Hello, world!", "How are you?", "The weather is great today.", "What's your favorite book?"]

# Initialize the engine
engine = VectorSearchEngine()

# Generate embeddings and create the index
embeddings = engine.encode(texts)
engine.create_index(embeddings)

# Search for a similar text
distances, indices = engine.search("Good day!")
print(f"Most similar text: {texts[indices[0][0]]}, Distance: {distances[0][0]}")
